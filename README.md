GovConnect - Unified Government Service Platform

## Description
GovConnect is an e-government enterprise system designed to provide citizens with convenient access to government services and information through a unified platform. The backend of the project is developed using Spring Boot, while the frontend is implemented using Vue.js. This system aims to streamline government operations, enhance citizen engagement, and improve the delivery of public services.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture:** The project follows a microservices architecture, allowing each government service or department to be developed as a separate microservice.
- **RESTful API:** Communication between microservices and the frontend is facilitated through RESTful APIs, ensuring seamless data exchange.
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to safeguard sensitive information and restrict access to authorized users.
- **Database Integration:** Each microservice has its own database for storing relevant data, ensuring data isolation and scalability.
- **Vue.js Frontend:** The frontend is developed using Vue.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for citizens to interact with government services.
- **API Gateway:** An API Gateway is utilized to manage incoming requests, route them to the appropriate microservices, and handle authentication and authorization.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Spring Boot, Java
- Frontend: Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: MySQL
- API Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway

# Dockerization-of-Spring-boot-Microservice

Successfully containerized a Spring-boot microservice using Docker and Docker Compose. Developed a Dockerfile to build an image with OpenJDK for a Java-based application and configured “docker-compose.yml” for multi-container orchestration. Networked and port bind with MySQL and phpMyAdmin. 

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the microservice.
- `target/`: Contains the build artifacts generated by Maven.
- `.dockerignore`: Specifies files and directories to exclude when building Docker images.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the steps to build the Docker image for the microservice.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker services for the microservice and any dependencies.
